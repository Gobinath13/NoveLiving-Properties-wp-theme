##  Custom Features & Structure
- *Homepage* (front-page.php): A custom homepage layout with sections for visuals and content blocks.
- *Header & Footer*:
  - header.php and footer.php are modular and cleanly coded.
- *Images*: Several optimized images included for design mockups or placeholder content.
- *Minimal Assets*: Organized under CSS/, making it easy to manage custom styles.
---
##  Custom Post Types
Currently, there are *no separate custom post types* defined in functions.php.  
If you plan to use CPTs like “Projects” or “Testimonials,” you can register them using WordPress's register_post_type() inside functions.php or in a separate file.

##  Performance Optimizations
-  *Image Optimization*: All images used are pre-compressed JPEGs to reduce load time.
-  *Modular Files*: Each layout component is split into separate PHP files to keep the code maintainable.
-  *No Heavy Frameworks*: No bloated libraries or external CSS/JS frameworks are used — improving speed and control.

##  Included Visual Assets
- Multiple preloaded images (.jpeg and .jpg) for banners, backgrounds, or demo content.
- A PDF file (webpage.pdf) is included — possibly as a layout reference or design guide.
